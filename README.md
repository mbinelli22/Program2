# Program2
• Establish three variables to hold the three measurements which are required to define a room, (length, width, height), as well as a 
  fourth variable to hold the units that the measurements are being given in. 
• Set the values of each of the four variables to match that of a room that you are familiar with. 
• Calculate the total surface area of only the floor of the room defined by your chosen dimensions. (Your formula must work with any values
  that you could assign your three dimension variables) 
• Calculate the total surface area of only the four walls of the room defined by your chosen dimensions. (Your formula must work with any 
  values that you could assign your three dimension variables) 
• Display the surface area (in your units squared) of the floor of the room to the screen in a reasonable report format. 
• Display the total surface area (in your units squared) of the four walls of the room to the screen in a reasonable report format.
